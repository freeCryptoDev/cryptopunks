### CryptoPunks Collectible Characters on the Ethereum Blockchain

### Verifying the Punks are 100% Authentic and Legit CryptoPunks(tm)

To allow verification that the punks being managed by the CryptoPunks Ethereum contract are the same as what you see in the image, we have embedded a SHA256 hash of the image file containing all the punks into the contract. You can generate this hash for the punks image file via a command line similar to ```openssl sha -sha256 punks.png``` and compare that to the embedded hash in the contract ```ac39af4793119ee46bbff351d8cb6b5f23da60222126add4268e261199a2921b```.
